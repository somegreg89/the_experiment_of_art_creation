# The Experiment of Art Creation

Here you find my implementation of this experiment which we observe what creation actually is.

My pygame skills are not good and this is literally my first pygame program, so there may be things that could be done much better.

# Controls
With the space bar, you set the starting point of the line, and after you release the space bar it will set the last position of the line. That's how you draw lines here.

* Z key is for undo the line (only one time)
* H key is for hide the grid image so you can see crearly what you drew

# Encourange
If you want to improve it or make your own implementation, you just need to follow these rules:

* There is a ball that starts at a random position, this ball moves in a straight trajectory and bounces when it reaches some corner of the screen, the bouncing occurs at random angles.
* When you press a button, the ball will start to draw its path, or in case it bounces, it will move the line along with it. When you stop pressing the button, the ball leaves the stroke at the position where you stopped pressing the button.
